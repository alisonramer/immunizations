      <h4><a href="/q1"><img class="down" src="down.png"><img class="right" src="right.png"><img>What is on this site?</a></h4>
      <p>On this website, you will find a visual representation of immunization information for Washington State schools, specifically immunization of 6th graders. On the Schools Map, you can click on each individual school to read more information about student immunizations. On the County Map, you can click on each county for similar information but averaged for each county. Additionally, the County Map includes information on the occurrence of pertussis in 2015. The Graphs highlights several aspects of the immunization data in graphical format.</p>
      <h4><a href="/q2"><img class="down" src="down.png"><img class="right" src="right.png">Where did this information come from?</a></h4>
      <p>The school immunization information is reported by individual schools to the Washington State Department of Health and is publicly available from data.WA.gov (<a href="https://data.wa.gov/Health/Sixth-6th-grade-immunization-data-by-school-2015-2/9vf7-7een" target="_blank" >link to data</a>). The information on 2015 incidences of pertussis is publicly available from the Washington State Department of Health (<a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/Pubs/348-253-PertussisAnnualSummary.pdf" target="_blank">link to data</a>). Some other information displayed on the maps and graphs involves simple calculations (averages, ordering) using the obtained data. </p>
      <h4><a href="/q3"><img class="down" src="down.png"><img class="right" src="right.png">What vaccinations are required?</a></h4>
      <p>In Washington State, the following vaccinations are required (although there are also exemption criteria) for school attendance: pertussis, varicella, diptheria and tetanus, measles, mumps, and rubella, hepatitis B, and polio (see <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/YouandYourFamily/Immunization/DiseasesandVaccines" target="_blank">this Washington State Department of Health site</a> for more information.)</p>
      <h4><a href="/q4"><img class="down" src="down.png"><img class="right" src="right.png">Why 6th graders?</a></h4>
      <p>A mildly curious person can easily discover that immunization information is available for K-12 in Washington State. Unfortunately, creating and displaying this information requires working with a large quantity of data points, each of which have to be transformed into a useful format. The 6th grade data was chosen for the practical reason of transforming the data while still providing a reasonable cross section of information that is not overwhelming to the user.</p>
      <h4><a href="/q5"><img class="down" src="down.png"><img class="right" src="right.png">What are the ranks found on the County Map and the Graphs?</a></h4>
      <p>The ranks are a convenient way to show multiple types of data together. For example, if a county has a 10 incidences of pertussis per 100,000 and 21% of students did not have the pertussis vaccination, that is a lot less informative than saying they rank 7th in pertussis incidence and 15th in pertussis vaccination. Lower ranks indicate better vaccine compliance, higher student or school numbers, and lower incidences of pertussis. In other words, like in golf, lower numbers are better. The ranks range from 1 to 33 for pertussis incidence (due to some counties having not reported data). All the other ranks range from 1 to 38.</p>
      <h4><a href="/q6"><img class="down" src="down.png"><img class="right" src="right.png">How reliable is this information?</a></h4>
      <p>The immunization data is generally provided by parents or guardians to schools. However, most schools do not verify the information with healthcare providers. Additionally, not all schools report data. It is difficult to know whether immunization information has been falsely reported or not reported by parents/guardians. The pertussis incidences are reported by healthcare providers. Pertussis, like all diseases requiring vaccination, are by law required to be reported to the state.</p>
      <h4><a href="/q7"><img class="down" src="down.png"><img class="right" src="right.png">Why the focus on pertussis?</a></h4>
      <p>Fortunately, the incidence of many of the other diseases we vaccinate against are very low or nonexistent in Washington State currently. For those that still occur at significant rates (such as hepatitis B and varicella), incidence information is not as readily available by county as it is for pertussis.</p>
      <h4><a href="/q8"><img class="down" src="down.png"><img class="right" src="right.png">Some of these numbers seem unrealistic, don't they?</a></h4>
      <p>Yes. Many schools are very small, so the rates of vaccination compliance and based on only a few students. The same is true for county data - in a lot of smaller counties, data is based only very few students and schools, and thus may not be representative of the actual county overall. One of the graphs highlights some of the information from only the top six counties (by number of 6th graders) which represent a much larger sample size. However, the data from smaller schools and counties is still informative - just not necessarily compelling in terms of making broad generalizations.</p>
